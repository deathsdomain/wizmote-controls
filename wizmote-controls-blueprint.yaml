    # Wizmote Control

    This blueprint provides a set of controls for a Wizmote device, allowing you to assign custom actions to the buttons on the device.

    Works with an ESPHome device with a [custom component](https://github.com/jesserockz/wizmote-esphome) installed to listen for button
    presses from the WizMote, broadcasting an event to Home Assistant to interpret.

    ```yaml
    # sample esphome configuration
    external_components:
      - source: github://jesserockz/wizmote-esphome
        components:
          - esp_now
          - wizmote
    esp_now:

    wizmote:
      on_button:
        - homeassistant.event:
            event: esphome.wizmote_action
            data:
              mac: !lambda 'return format_hex(data.bssid, 6);'
              button: !lambda 'return data.button;'
              sequence: !lambda 'return data.sequence;'
    ```
